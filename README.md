[**Alumnyy**](http://alumnyyinc.pythonanywhere.com/) is an application which focuses strictly on universities’, colleges’ and other tertiary institutions’ alumni.

Alumni will get to be part of alma mater spaces where they will be able to connct and engage in conversations as intellectuals.

# Usage

Users/alumni are placed in alma mater spaces which are based on the entered tertiary institution during signup for now. Alumni are ale to request to connect with a fellow alumni, delete sent connection requests, decline/reject received connection requests and approve received connection requests. 

In addition, there is the Posts section of the application which allows all alumni of an alma mater space to engage in any conversation or broadcast any thoughts. Alumni are allowed to simply remove posts they have posted. 

Other features include seeing another alumnus' limited profile details and then seeing the same profile in detail if connected. Connections can see each other's contact details such as biography, email and mobile number which can then be used for more effective communication outside of the application.

 In the future there will be an in application chat feature and toggle button for privacy conscious alumni to control the visibility of contact details from other alumni. Furthermore, the posts feature will include commenting and pictures.
